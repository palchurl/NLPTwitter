# CSCI 49362 Final Project
Can Twitter Help You Win At Fantasy Football?
By: Lakshmi Palchuri, Nuzhat Khan, Adam Mohammad

Abstract
For our project, we performed sentiment analysis on an unexplored domain of Twitter, fantasy football. While previous sentiment analysis on Twitter data has explored topics like business and politics, we thought it would be interesting to look into a topic about a popular hobby. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether we could rank football athletes according to the sentiment expressed towards them on Twitter and whether this ranking could be used to predict their performance. Using the VADER library, we took a rule and lexical-based approach to sentiment analysis. We found that we could moderately predict rankings, as the average accuracy percentage over the time period observed was 44.17%. However, we believe that there are ways to improve these results, primarily through the analysis of a longer time period.
